# Python-DSA

This repository contains my practice implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python. The goal of this repository is to improve my understanding of fundamental DSA concepts and enhance my problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific topic or set of problems. Below is an overview of the structure:

```
C_1/
├── 1_aplusb.py               # Sum of two numbers
├── 2_maximumpairwiseproduct.py # Maximum pairwise product
├── 3_fibonacci.py            # Fibonacci sequence
├── 4_gcd.py                  # Greatest common divisor
├── __tests__/                # Unit tests for the implementations
│   └── aplusb_test.py        # Tests for 1_aplusb.py
```

## Implementations

### 1. Sum of Two Numbers

- **File**: `C_1/1_aplusb.py`
- **Description**: A simple function to compute the sum of two integers.

### 2. Maximum Pairwise Product

- **File**: `C_1/2_maximumpairwiseproduct.py`
- **Description**: Efficient and naive implementations to find the maximum product of two numbers in a list.

### 3. Fibonacci Sequence

- **File**: `C_1/3_fibonacci.py`
- **Description**: Recursive and iterative implementations to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

### 4. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

- **File**: `C_1/4_gcd.py`
- **Description**: Naive and Euclidean algorithm implementations to compute the GCD of two numbers.

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in the `__tests__` directory. The tests are written using Python's `unittest` framework. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover C_1/__tests__
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
